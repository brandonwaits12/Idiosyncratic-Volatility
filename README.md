# The Cross Section of Volatility and Expected Returns

This project is founded on the seminal paper "The Cross-Section of Volatility and Expected Returns" published by ANDREW ANG, ROBERT J. HODRICK, YUHANG XING, and XIAOYAN ZHANG in Febuary 2006 Journal of Finance. 

This project aims to replicate the main results of the paper, extend the results to out of sample time periods, and translate the results into a practical trading strategy.
